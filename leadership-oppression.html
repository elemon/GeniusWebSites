			<p id="o"><i>Oppressor oppressed oppression:</i><br>An oppressor is one who uses her/his power to dominate another or who refuses to use her/his power to challenge that domination.<br>
			<br>
			An oppressed is one who is dominated by an oppressor and by those who consent with their
			silence.<br>
			Oppression is the power and the effects of domination in the United States. There are many forms
			of often interlocking systems of oppression; white supremacy, capitalism, imperialism,
			patriarchy, heterosexism, ageism, ablism, anti-Semitism and state sanctioned violence, etc.
			In a white supremacist capitalist patriarchy and heterosexist system, all non-ruling class whites,
			the working poor and middle classes are in some way oppressed by that system. However, they
			are also privileged by it when they organize against their own oppression but not against their
			privilege that is against the oppression of people of color. They in fact, become oppressors of
			people of color, inaction is complicity, and silence is consent. To cease being oppressors, white
			people must act against ALL oppression.</p>
